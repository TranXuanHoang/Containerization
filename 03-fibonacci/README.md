# Fibonacci Calculator

This project builds a `multi-container` web application that provides a simple UI allowing users to calculate arbitrary [fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). The purpose of building such simple calculator with a way more complicated `multi-container` architecture is to learn how to create complex web apps with multiple service components that are wrapped inside different `Docker containers`.
