# Goals

This project works on building a web app containing multiple containers that interract with each other to process, save and retrieve app data as well as presenting the data to the front-end GUI.

The project demonstrates how to dockerize a `MongoDB`, a `React` front-end app, and a `Node.js` back-end server. It also shows how to utilize `Docker Volumes` to persist the database data and logs data output by the back-end server.
