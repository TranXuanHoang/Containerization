# Fibonacci Calculator with Kubernetes

> This project create the same app as developed in the [03-fibonacci](../03-fibonacci) project except that here `Kubernetes` is used to orchestrate a set of containers forming the web app.

This project builds a `multi-container` web application that provides a simple UI allowing users to calculate arbitrary [fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). The purpose of building such simple calculator with a way more complicated `multi-container` architecture is to learn how to create complex web apps with multiple service components using `Docker` and `Kubernetes`.
